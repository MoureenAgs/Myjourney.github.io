    <h1>My Childhood</h1>
    <p>Where I began—Foundation, family, and dreams</p>

  <section class="story">
    <p>I grew up in a small, close-knit community where life was simple but full of adventure. My childhood was filled with long afternoons playing outside, storytelling with family, and helping out around the home.
        One of my favorite childhood memories is the day my father brought home our very first computer. It was a bulky desktop with a classic white CRT monitor and a small screen, but to me, it was magical. That moment sparked my fascination with computers. I remember rushing home from school every day, eager to power it on and dive into my favorite game at the time — Pinball. 
        That simple setup ignited a passion that continues to shape my journey today.
    </p>
    <p>My family has always been my biggest support system, and many of my values today were shaped by the love and lessons I received growing up.</p>
