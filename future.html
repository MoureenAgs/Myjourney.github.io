  <section class="Looking Ahead">
    <p>As I continue to grow academically and personally, I envision a future where I actively contribute to the global tech landscape. I aspire to work with leading technology companies and impactful organizations — collaborating on solutions that address real-world 
        challenges and drive innovation across communities.</p>
    <p>I'm especially passionate about using technology as a tool for positive change. Whether it’s through volunteering with initiatives that promote digital literacy or building scalable solutions for underserved regions, 
        I want to be part of a movement that bridges gaps and empowers others.</p>
        <p>In the long term, I hope to take part in programs that focus on global development and technological sustainability. 
            Working with companies like
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a> Microsoft that share this vision would be a dream come true.</p>
            <p>No matter where the journey takes me, I remain committed to learning, growing, and building with purpose — always striving to create a better, more connected world through technology.</p>
